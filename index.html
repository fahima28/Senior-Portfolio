        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Fahim Ahamed, I am 17 years old and a junior in high school. Currently I am learning how to code using the Python language in my Programming and Protoyping class from which I learned many basic skills in the web development process. Furthermore, adding the icing to the cake I have some background knowledge in the field! Last year during my sophomore year of high school, I took Web Design & Development where I learned the basic principles of HTML & CSS and also hints of JavaScript, which is more complex. HTML is used to build the actual body and content of the website while cascading style sheets (CSS) is used more or so for the visual element of the website and for customization purposes to really make it unique!</p>
